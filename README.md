## A little python script to scrap an amazing webserial and format it as an epub.

For a few months ago I have been reading an amazing web serial: [The Wondering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/), but I would like to read \

To develop the script I use [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [EbookLib](https://pypi.org/project/EbookLib/), \
